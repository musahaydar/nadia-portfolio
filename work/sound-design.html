                        <h2><i>Into The Woods</i></h2>
                        <h4>November 2024</h4>
                        <p>I sound designed and mixed a production of Into the Woods, produced by <a href="https://make-lemonade.com/into-the-woods">Make Lemonade Productions</a> and directed by Jenna Roth. For the effects design, I sourced from platforms such as Splice and Epidemic Sound, but I also recorded things on my Zoom H4N, and I edited in Logic Pro. I used Qlab 4 for playback during the show. For system design, I had to be efficient as we were unable to individually mic each one of the fifteen actors with the available resources and space. Ultimately, eight of the actors were miked with lavaliers and ear-worn microphones, with additional amplification for the whole ensemble using boundary microphones. Additionally, there was a live band consisting of drums, strings, woodwind, brass, and multiple keyboards. Signal flow involved using a Yamaha Rio and Dante in order to mix all instruments and microphones on a Yamaha QL1.</a></p>

                        <h4>September 2024</h4>
                        <p>Directed by Sophie Leiton-Toomey and Heaven Lei Lucas, <a href="https://linktr.ee/princesshamletnyc"> Princess Hamlet</a> is a gender-bent version of the iconic Shakespeare play, set in the modern day Hamptons. I sourced sounds from Splice and Epidemic Sounds and edited and mixed in Logic Pro. I also designed and composed various sounds using Logic's built-in synthesizers. Everything was compiled in QLab 4, which I control during the shows. Princess Hamlet was performed during the <a href="https://www.rjtheatrecompany.com/circlefestival">RJ Theater Circle Festival.</a></p>

                        <p>I do sound design, ADR, editing, and mixing for visual content, primarily in Pro Tools. The following video is a totally fake advertisement for a totally fake YouTube channel, created by one of my NYU professors, which I was assigned to entirely sound design. I pulled various kitchen-related sounds from <a href="https://freesound.org">freesound.org</a> and designed some of the musical sounds heard in Logic Pro, editing everything in Pro Tools.</p>

                        <h4>2023</h4>
                        <p>For my Electroacoustic Composition class at NYU Prague, a classmate and I teamed up to create a sound art piece made entirely from iPhone videos we had taken throughout our semester abroad. We pulled the audio from these videos and edited them in Pro Tools, altering them greatly to create soundscapes that varied from musical and rhythmic to ambient, mixing the piece for the 5.1 sound system which it was presented in. The following stereo mix doesn’t do the immersive experience justice.</p>

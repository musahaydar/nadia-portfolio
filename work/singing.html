                    <p>I was a member of the 75-person ensemble/choir in "Follies in Concert" at Carnegie Hall, performing behind icons such as Jennifer Holliday and Norm Lewis, led by the incredible Joey Chancey. According to the lovely woman I stood next to on the risers, I sang beautifully.</p>

                    <p>Village Voices is a vocal jazz ensemble at NYU, led by renowned industry professionals Lauren Kinhan and Janis Siegel. I joined my senior year, singing Soprano and Alto in pieces ranging from jazz standards to SATB arrangements of Joni Mitchell and the Beach Boys. I got to be part of three live performances and three studio recording sessions engineered by another member, Alex Park, to record some of our repertoire.</p>

                    <h4>June 2024</h4>
                    <p>I was a member of one of NYU's competitive a cappella groups, the Vocaholics. I mostly sang Soprano and Alto and was also Assistant Music Director during my last four semesters. For my senior song, I arranged and taught “Butterfly Net” by Caroline Polachek, notated in MuseScore. (Vocal percussion is not included in the notation but was directed during rehearsals.)</p>
